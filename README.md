## 📖 Overview
This repository contains experimental scripts and assets built using the **Ren'Py Visual Novel Engine**. It explores the intersection of creative writing and Python-based logic to create branching narratives and interactive experiences.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- **Scripting:** Utilizing Ren'Py's specialized language for scene management and character dialogue.
- **Python Integration:** Leveraging Python for complex game state tracking, persistent data, and custom screen logic.
- **Asset Management:** Coordination of visual assets, audio cues, and UI components.

## 🚀 Learning Goals
Exploring game mechanics outside of traditional engines (like Unity or Unreal) to understand how narrative-heavy games handle user choice and state persistence.

## 🎓 Academic Connection
A creative extension of my software development journey at **RJIT**, demonstrating a versatile approach to programming and design.
